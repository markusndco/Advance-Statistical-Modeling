# Credit Score Regression Analysis

This project explores the demographic and financial factors that influence individual credit scores using **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression**. The analysis is based on a structured dataset containing attributes such as income, balance, student status, and rating class. The goal is to quantify the strength and direction of key predictors on creditworthiness.

## 📊 Dataset Summary

The dataset includes the following variables:
- `Income`: Annual income of the customer
- `Balance`: Outstanding credit card balance
- `Student`: Whether the customer is a student
- `RatingClass`: Target variable representing credit rating

---

## 🧪 Methodology

- Performed exploratory data analysis to understand variable distributions
- Built multiple OLS regression models to assess:
  - Individual effects of income and balance
  - Impact of student status on credit rating
  - Combined models with interaction terms
- Evaluated model fit using:
  - R² and adjusted R²
  - p-values and confidence intervals
  - Residual analysis for linearity and homoscedasticity

---

## 🔍 Key Findings

- **Income and balance** are significant predictors of credit score.
- **Students** tend to have higher or lower ratings depending on balance behavior.
- Multicollinearity was assessed and managed through model refinement.
- The final model provides interpretable coefficients for predicting credit rating outcomes.

## 🛠 Tools Used

- Microsoft Excel (data preprocessing)
- SAS (modeling and diagnostics)
- Basic data visualizations (e.g., boxplots, scatter plots)
