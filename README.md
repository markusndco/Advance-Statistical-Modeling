# 📈 Advance Statistical Modeling

A curated collection of advanced statistical modeling projects applying a variety of techniques including:

- **OLS Regression**
- **Generalized Linear Models (GLMs)**
- **Poisson Distribution**
- **Survival Analysis**
- **Multilevel (Hierarchical) Models**
- **Classification Algorithms**

Each folder contains a real-world case study with **end-to-end analysis** in **R**, covering:
- Business problem framing
- Data wrangling
- Feature engineering
- Model fitting and diagnostics
- Interpretation of results
